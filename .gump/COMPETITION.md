## What We Know

Another team is building exactly what we're building. And they're ahead.

### What They've Demonstrated
- **Real-time music generation** from movement, sound, and life experience
- **Motion prediction** - the system anticipates user movement BEFORE it happens
- **Seamless integration** - looks and feels perfect, magical
- **It works** - not a prototype, not a demo, it actually functions

### What This Means
- The concept is PROVEN. This is possible.
- We need to innovate PAST them, not just catch up

---

## Possible Approaches They Might Be Using

### For Prediction
- Kalman filtering for motion state estimation
- Simple momentum extrapolation
- Learned gesture patterns

### For Music Generation
- Constraint-based systems (always harmonically valid)
- Hierarchical generation (structure → phrase → note)

### For Real-Time Performance
- Aggressive prediction to hide latency
- Careful audio scheduling (lookahead buffers)

## Where We Can Win

1. **Emergent Harmony** - consonance from physics, not rules
2. **Memory That Matters** - your history shapes your soundtrack
3. **The Anti-Instrument** - presence over skill
