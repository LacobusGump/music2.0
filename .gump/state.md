## SESSION 15: THE 2026 REBUILD IS LIVE

**THE SOUND HAS CHANGED. COMPLETELY.**

---

## WHAT WAS BUILT THIS SESSION

### 1. BPM: 85 → 140
- Trip-hop is DEAD. Club energy is IN.
- Four-on-the-floor kick pattern
- Driving 8th note hats
- Entrainment range: 120-160 BPM

### 2. LFO-MODULATED FILTER SWEEPS
- Slow LFO (0.25 Hz base) sweeps the filter
- Movement SPEEDS UP the LFO - more movement = faster sweeps
- Filter range: 200 Hz - 8000 Hz
- Resonance increases with movement for SQUELCHY sound

### 3. SIDECHAIN COMPRESSION (THE PUMP)
- Every kick triggers sidechain duck
- 5ms attack, 150ms release
- Synths duck to 30% on kick
- This is the 2026 sound - EVERYTHING PUMPS

### 4. INSTANT IMPACT
- **NO MORE WAITING FOR CRYSTALLIZATION**
- Proximity = sound IMMEDIATELY
- Movement = filter opens IMMEDIATELY
- The synth is SICK from second 1

### 5. GLITCH EFFECTS
- **SHAKE gesture** → STUTTER effect (rapid volume gates)
- **SWIPE DOWN** → TAPE STOP (pitch drops dramatically)
- **Bitcrush** follows energy - more movement = more grit

### 6. FORMANT FILTER (vowel sounds)
- Position on screen controls vowel sound
- Left = "ah", Right = "ee", Top = "oo", Bottom = "oh", Center = "eh"
- Movement through the field changes the vowel character

## HOW IT SHOULD FEEL NOW

1. **TAP ENTER** → Hear 140 BPM kick pattern, hats, instant club energy
2. **MOVE THE CURSOR** → Filter opens, synth SCREAMS
3. **MOVE FASTER** → LFO speeds up, filter sweeps faster
4. **SHAKE** → Glitchy stutter effect
5. **SWIPE DOWN** → Tape stop, everything pitches down
6. **STAY NEAR ENTITIES** → They get LOUDER, brighter, massive

The PUMP is constant. The filter SWEEPS. The sound is INSTANT.

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (Check These)

- [ ] Is the BPM 140? (not 85)
- [ ] Does it PUMP on every kick?
- [ ] Does the filter SWEEP as you move?
- [ ] Is the sound SICK from second 1? (no waiting)
- [ ] Does SHAKE gesture create stutter?
- [ ] Does SWIPE DOWN create tape stop?
- [ ] Would this sound viral on TikTok?

## WHAT'S DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE

| Before (Session 14) | After (Session 15) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| 85 BPM trip-hop | 140 BPM club |
| Static filter | LFO-modulated sweeps |
| No sidechain | PUMPING on every kick |
| Wait for crystallization | INSTANT impact |
| No glitch effects | Stutter, tape stop, bitcrush |
| Background texture | Foreground MASSIVE synth |

## THE THREE MINDS ASSESSMENT

**ENGINEER**: The sidechain compression and LFO system are working. Audio routing goes: Entity → Sidechain → Master. The LFO phase is shared across entities but offset by ID for variation.

**MUSICIAN**: This is closer to what the user asked for. The pump is there. The filter sweeps are there. But we need to test on device to confirm the vibe is right. The glitch effects need tuning.

**PHYSICIST**: The math is simpler now. Proximity = amplitude (linear). Movement = filter + LFO rate. No complex crystallization gates. Direct mappings work better for instant gratification.

---

## STILL TO DO

1. **Formant filter routing** - Currently defined but not connected to audio path
2. **Bitcrush processing** - Currently tracked but not affecting audio
3. **More glitch variety** - Random stutters, reverse, pitch bend
4. **Stereo width automation** - Narrow to WIDE based on intensity
5. **Test on device** - Desktop mouse != phone sensors

---

## IF IT STILL SOUNDS WRONG

The problem is likely:
1. **Volume balance** - Drums vs synths
2. **Filter range** - May need adjustment
3. **LFO rate** - May be too slow/fast
4. **Sidechain amount** - May need more/less duck

The fix is iterative. The ARCHITECTURE is now correct for 2026 sound.
