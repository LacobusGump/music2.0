## 🧠 MAGENTA.JS INTEGRATION - LIVE 🧠

**We are close. The AI is generating patterns.**

### WHAT'S RUNNING NOW

1. **TensorFlow.js + @magenta/music** loaded from CDN
2. **DrumsRNN** - Neural network generating drum patterns
3. **MelodyRNN** - Loaded and ready for melody generation
4. **Real samples** from freesound.org as sound sources
5. **Professional FX chain** - saturation, compression, reverb, delay

### THE DIALS (Fibonacci Minimalism)

**PULSE** (beats character)
- `—` = off
- `dust` = lo-fi, slow, sparse
- `gold` = mid-tempo, groove
- `drive` = fast, energetic

**DEPTH** (bass character)
- `—` = off
- `sub` = pure sine sub
- `thick` = sawtooth, aggressive
- `warm` = triangle, mellow

**HAZE** (master texture)
- `clear` = clean, open
- `fog` = lo-fi filtered
- `glass` = bright, reverby
- `heat` = warm, delayed

### HOW THE AI WORKS

1. **Seed Sequence** - Genre-specific drum pattern as starting point
2. **DrumsRNN.continueSequence()** - AI extends the pattern
3. **Temperature** - Scales with intensity (0.8-1.2)
4. **Pattern Queue** - Pre-generated patterns, auto-refills
5. **Fallback** - Euclidean rhythms if AI fails

### THE CORE LOOP

```
motion → energy → intensity → temperature → AI patterns
   ↓
field position → pitch/filter → bass/pad voicing
   ↓
orb crosses center → melody layer spawns
   ↓
phrase builds → music emerges
```

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING

- [x] Magenta DrumsRNN generating patterns
- [x] Real samples from freesound.org
- [x] Professional FX chain (sat/comp/verb/delay)
- [x] Motion → energy → intensity feedback
- [x] Orb system spawns melody layers
- [x] Fibonacci-spaced minimal UI
- [x] Lo-fi filter + texture system
- [x] Bass synthesis with LFO modulation
- [x] Pad chords following genre

## 🎯 WHAT'S NEXT (to reach "omg")

1. **MelodyRNN integration** - AI-generated melodic lines
2. **More sample variety** - expand drum kit per genre
3. **Ghost events** - subtle surprises (reverse, whisper, sub drop)
4. **Intensity arc** - build/drop over longer phrases
5. **Record/loop user gestures** - the original layer vision

## 🌟 THE ETERNAL LOOP 🌟

**User's wish:** "Just make sure it consistently pushes updates for as long as it can in life. I don't know how long I'm gonna be around but I would want this to continue."

The autonomous loop is now running continuously:
- Cycles every 4 hours
- Pushes improvements to GitHub
- Live at lacobusgump.github.io/music2.0/
- The Four Minds keep building

**This project will keep evolving.**

Even when no one is watching, GUMP grows.

## 📜 KEY PRINCIPLES (Learned From Journey)

1. **Motion → Energy → Music** - Core feedback loop
2. **Real samples > synthesis** - "A real artist steals"
3. **AI patterns never repeat** - Magenta generates fresh each bar
4. **Fibonacci minimalism** - UI sparse, golden ratio
5. **Ghosts in the machine** - Subtle surprises
6. **Lo-fi aesthetic** - Warmth, texture, dust
