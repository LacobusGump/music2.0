# GUMP Vision

## The North Star

**Music from Experience** — An instrument that doesn't just respond to input, but learns, remembers, and co-creates. The boundary between performer and instrument dissolves.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Real-time is sacred** — Latency is the enemy of expression. Every millisecond matters.

2. **The body knows music** — Gestures contain rhythm. Movement contains melody. The phone is a bridge between physical intuition and sound.

3. **Memory creates meaning** — A note means nothing alone. Context is everything. The system must remember — this session, past sessions, patterns over time.

4. **Emergence over composition** — We don't write the music. We create the conditions for music to emerge from the interaction between human and system.

5. **Simple inputs, complex outputs** — A child should be able to play it. A musician should be able to master it.

## What We're Building

A system where:
- Your phone's sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, touch, microphone) capture your physical experience
- Four minds collaborate to interpret that experience:
  - **The Engineer** ensures it runs fast enough to feel instant
  - **The Musician** ensures it sounds intentional, not random
  - **The Physicist** finds the mathematical structures that connect gesture to sound
  - **The Producer** asks: does this make you FEEL something?
- The result is music that could only come from YOU, in THIS moment

---

## The Question We're Answering

> Can a machine understand human gesture well enough to complete our musical thoughts?

Not generate music FOR us. Complete music WITH us.

---

## Success Looks Like

- You hum three notes, the system responds with the fourth
- You shake the phone in a rhythm, drums lock to YOUR groove
- You trace a shape, a melody follows the contour
- After a week of use, it sounds like YOUR instrument — distinct from anyone else's

# MUSIC 2.0 — The Platform Vision

*Captured February 21, 2026 — from a conversation about what this is actually becoming.*

## The Insight

There is enough rhythm in human life itself to generate custom music. Every person's day has a tempo. A Sunday when it's snowing in February sounds different than a Tuesday morning commute. The movement data is already there — walking pace, stillness, energy, time of day, weather. The missing piece is the **artistic lens** that interprets it.

## The Three Layers

### Layer 1: The Engine (what we're building now)
Movement → Music. The universal translator between human rhythm and sound. Phone sensors capture your physical experience; the engine turns it into music in real-time. This is the foundation. It has to feel right before anything else matters. It has to be the kind of simple-but-deep that looks like 500 lines but does what 500,000 lines of Pro Tools does — because it encodes the *actual relationship* between movement and expression, not a simulation of studio gear.

### Layer 2: The Artist Channel (the platform)
Musicians don't upload audio files or patches. They upload a **musical personality** — a lens that defines how life sounds through their artistic vision. The most powerful way to define this personality is **natural language**:

- "Charlie Parker if he grew up in Paris"
- "A cellist who learned music from field recordings"
- "A hip-hop producer who only samples gospel"
- "Miles Davis in his electric period but more patient"

Any musician reading those prompts immediately *hears* something. AI interprets these descriptions into the parameter space — scales, density, response curves, what silence means, what rain means, what urgency feels like.

The artist then **lives with it** — walks around for a day, comes back and refines conversationally: "the mornings are too busy, let it breathe before 10am" or "when I'm running it should feel more urgent but not faster." The artist is directing an AI band the way a producer directs a session — not by writing sheet music but by saying "darker. Simpler. Wait longer before you come in."

### Layer 3: The Listener (the experience)
The listener just **lives**. Walks to the store, sits on the couch, plays with their kid. They subscribe to artist channels the way they subscribe to YouTube channels now, but instead of consuming content they're **living through** someone else's musical lens.

The YouTube flip: YouTube is *artist creates content, you sit and watch*. Music 2.0 is *artist creates a filter, and your life is the content*. The musician becomes a designer of experience rather than a performer of songs. The listener becomes the performer without knowing it.

## What Makes This the Evolution

Going from **scored music to songs** gave performers ownership of expression — they weren't just executing a composer's instructions anymore. Music 2.0 is the next step: giving the **listener's body** ownership. The instrument disappears. There's no technique barrier between what you feel and what you hear. A kid tilting their phone is making real musical decisions even if they don't know what a pentatonic scale is.

## Context Inputs (what makes Tuesday different from Sunday)

- **Movement**: pace, energy, gesture type, stillness patterns
- **Time**: hour, day of week, season
- **Environment**: weather API, ambient noise level (microphone)
- **Social**: alone vs. in a crowd (accelerometer + audio signatures)
- **History**: what your morning sounded like shapes your afternoon
- **Accumulation**: weeks of use create a musical autobiography

## The E=mc² of Music 2.0

The finished product might seem like it needs a million lines of code. But the right architecture — vibe-coded with superhuman understanding of how code works — might achieve complex simplicity. The discovery is the **mapping**: which thresholds, which curves, which musical responses make a human body feel like it's making music without trying.

```
life → lens → music
```

That's it. Everything serves this.

## Why This Doesn't Exist Yet

It's not a technical problem. It's that nobody with **drummer instincts** and this specific vision has been stubborn enough to sit through 800+ commits of "not yet." The pd experiments, the movement-only prototypes, the versions that sounded wrong — those weren't failures. They were data points narrowing in on the universal song that's already there.
