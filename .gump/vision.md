# GUMP Vision

## The North Star

**Music from Experience** - An instrument that doesn't just respond to input, but learns, remembers, and co-creates. The boundary between performer and instrument dissolves.

## Core Principles

1. **Real-time is sacred** - Latency is the enemy of expression. Every millisecond matters.

2. **The body knows music** - Gestures contain rhythm. Movement contains melody. The phone is a bridge between physical intuition and sound.

3. **Memory creates meaning** - A note means nothing alone. Context is everything. The system must remember - this session, past sessions, patterns over time.

4. **Emergence over composition** - We don't write the music. We create the conditions for music to emerge from the interaction between human and system.

5. **Simple inputs, complex outputs** - A child should be able to play it. A musician should be able to master it.

## What We're Building

A system where:
- Your phone's sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, touch, microphone) capture your physical experience
- Three minds collaborate to interpret that experience:
  - **The Engineer** ensures it runs fast enough to feel instant
  - **The Musician** ensures it sounds intentional, not random
  - **The Physicist** finds the mathematical structures that connect gesture to sound
- The result is music that could only come from YOU, in THIS moment

## The Question We're Answering

> Can a machine understand human gesture well enough to complete our musical thoughts?

Not generate music FOR us. Complete music WITH us.

---

## Success Looks Like

- You hum three notes, the system responds with the fourth
- You shake the phone in a rhythm, drums lock to YOUR groove
- You trace a shape, a melody follows the contour
- After a week of use, it sounds like YOUR instrument - distinct from anyone else's
