# GUMP Agent Team

## Mission
**Evolve music from static to dynamic.**

Static music: Pre-composed, plays the same every time, listener is passive.
Dynamic music: Emerges from interaction, never the same twice, listener is creator.

## How to Invoke

In a session, ask Claude to embody a specific agent:

```
"As eng-1, review the audio latency"
"As prod-1 (Rick Rubin), what should we remove?"
"As music-2, make the drums hit harder"
```

Or request a team review:

```
"Get the Music Pod's take on the current harmony system"
"Have prod-1 and prod-2 debate the conductor's autonomy"
```

## The North Star

A person picks up their phone. They move. Music emerges—not playing AT them, but playing WITH them. They put it down. Silence returns, having meant something.

That's dynamic music.
